GREAT is an analysis tool that can perform [[id:8efdee55-7343-455b-a476-fad7d61fcc86][gene ontology]] or pathway analysis
on genomic regions. What this means in practice, is that GREAT can determine
the biological significance of peak sets generated from [[id:f71f410f-c3a2-4f6e-9d73-08d016e0e692][ChIP-seq]] or[[id:d28c0463-33c4-4041-9da3-09393d83763a][ ATAC-seq]]
experiments.
