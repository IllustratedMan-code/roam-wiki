#+title: Statistics


Statistics is a method of understanding the world in terms of probability.
The likelyhood of an event occuring can be independant, or dependent on other events.

Statistical methods can be used to predict when an event is likely, or unlikely to occur.
Statistics should not be used as an absolute predictor of events. It's not "This will happen",
it is, "This will probably happen".


Statistics is especially relevant to the field of [[id:d1d9fda3-fb43-4888-a179-7f24ad0554eb][bioinformatics]].
