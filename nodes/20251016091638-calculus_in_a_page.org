#+title: Calculus in a page


There are three fundamental concepts in calculus. That's it! So if you
know these three concepts, other math concepts that depend upon these concepts
should be possible to learn. For example, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test][Z-test]] and the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test][Chi-squared]] test
both depend upon *integration*, one of the three concepts, to work.


Calculus is a hard /class/, not a hard /subject/. The class is hard because the fundamental
concepts are padded with lots of difficult algebra. There is usually lots of memorization of formulas and
procedures to solve specific equations. Luckily, we don't have to worry about any of that.


So, to get right into it, here are the three concepts:
1. Limits (sometimes taught in pre-calc)
2. Derivation
3. Integration


* function review

A function is a set of operations that takes input(s) and returns an output. These are an *extremely important* computer
science concept, but are also present in math.

In math, a function is defined like so:

\begin{equation}
f(x) = x+4
\end{equation

This function \(f\) takes 1 input and returns that input plus 4.

In R, the same function can be defined like so:

#+begin_src R

f <- function(x){
  x+4
}

f(5) # returns 9
f(3) # returns 7
#+end_src

Feel free to give it a try!

* Limits

With functions, there are certain values that can't be plugged in to the function. For example, \(\infty\). In math,
\(\infty\) is not a number, so \(\infty + 4\) doesn't really mean anything. Instead, to define what happens in this
case, there is a concept called the *limit*.

So, while we can't do \(f(\infty)\), we /can/ do \[ \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) \]. This
is basically saying, as the values for x get bigger and bigger, what happens to the output?
In this case, the answer is \[\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} x + 4 = \infty\]. This should hopefully make sense, \(4 + \infty\) is still \(\infty\).

Here is a 20 minute video on just limits if you want: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4LOp6PhBKM][What is a limit in calculus?]]

* Derivation (derivatives)
The reason we need to know about limits is that derivatives are defined as this: \[L=\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}h\]

Notice the limit notation. \(a\), represents all points in the /domain/ of \(f(x)\). So any valid value for \(x\) can be plugged
in for \(a\). Luckily, you don't have to memorize this (woohoo!). Instead, I'll describe what this formula means, then I'll
show a trick to do this formula without any algebra.

So what does this formula give you? Take our equation from before \(f(x) = x+4)\. The plot of this line might look like
this:

#+begin_src gnuplot :file 20251016091638-calculus_in_a_page/xplus4.png :exports results
plot x + 4
#+end_src

#+caption: The plot of f(x) = x+4
#+name: fig:figure1
#+RESULTS:

The plot of the derivative, however, looks like this:

#+begin_src gnuplot :file 20251016091638-calculus_in_a_page/derivative.png :exports results
plot 1
#+end_src

#+caption: The plot of the derivative of f(x) = x+4
#+name: fig:figure2
#+RESULTS:
[[file:20251016091638-calculus_in_a_page/derivative.png]]


If you looked carefully, you might have noticed that the line in [[fig:figure2]]
is equal to the /slope/ of the line in [[fig:figure1]]. This is what the "derivative" of
a function means. It is just another function (we'll call it \(f'(x)\)) where any value
that is plugged in will return the slope of the value returned by \(f(x)\).

So if we remember how to calculate slope using \(y=mx+b\), you'll notice that \(m\), the slope, is 1 when \(y=x+4\).

In summary, the derivative is just a way to calculate the slope of any point on a function.

So, how do we calculate the derivative without doing algebra?

If you have a function that looks like this:

\[f(x) = x^2\]

Then the derivative would look like this:

\[f(x) = 2x\]

So, to break this down, the exponent (2) is multiplied by the term (x), then the exponent is subtracted by 1.

In the case of multiple terms, as in a polynomial, this treatment is done for each term.

\[f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 5 \rightarrow 2x + 2 + 0  = f'(x)\]

Notice that the 5 evaluates to 0 because there is no variable (x). This is important, because
information is lost between a function and its derivative!

That it!

Here is a video from Khan academy with the basic concept (7 minutes): [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2PpRnFqnqY][Derivative as a concept]]

* Integration (Integrals)
We're almost done with calculus!

An Integral is just a derivative in reverse. It is really that simple!

But remember, we lost information when doing the derivative, and there isn't a way to get
that info back. So if the derivative of \(f(x) = x+4\) is \(1\), then when we do the integral,
we have no way of knowing that the 4 existed. So the integral of \(1\) is \(x + C\). \(C\) is
just a "constant", or any value that doesn't contain a variable.

Integrals are written like this:

\[ \int f(x) dx \]


While integrals are just a reverse derivatives, an integral of a function is equal to the
area under the line given by the original function. For example, the integral of \(x+4\)
actually returns the solid area of this graph:

#+begin_src gnuplot :file 20251016091638-calculus_in_a_page/area.png
set yrange [0:20]
plot x + 4 with filledcurves x1

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:20251016091638-calculus_in_a_page/area.png]]

If we wanted to calculate the area of the region between 0 and 5, we can use a *definite* integral.

With a definite integral, we ignore \(C\), and plug in a value for x twice, once with the big value (5) and once with the small value(0). These terms are then
subtracted.

\[\int^5_0 x + 4 dx \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}(5)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(0)^2 \rightarrow  12.5 \]

This gives us the area shown below:


#+begin_src gnuplot :file 20251016091638-calculus_in_a_page/area2.png

set yrange [0:20]
plot x+4, [0:5] x + 4 with filledcurves x1 

#+end_src
