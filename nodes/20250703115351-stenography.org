#+title: Stenography


Stenography is a form of writing where the words are formed phoenetically. This can be much
faster than regular typing, but is considerably harder to learn. I find it easier to think
in, like there is less of a barrier between me and the words. Since many words are typed in
one stroke, there is no mental load from spelling. I also can spell unfamiliar words without knowing
how they are spelled as long as I know how to pronounce them.
