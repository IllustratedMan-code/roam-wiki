Nextflow is a tool for writing bioinformatics pipelines. It can be thought of as an alternative
to GNU make.

One feature of nextflow is the existence of [[id:9346a728-b536-4a32-853b-7a317bc9ff4a][subworkflows]]. This makes nextflow pipelines modular.




* High Level Language description

Nextflow is written using three main primitives (workflows, named workflows, and processes).
It is essentially a superset of the [[https://groovy-lang.org/][groovy language]] (which is a layer on top of java).

Workflows and processes generally do not contain side effects. This is important
because processes can not emit side effects during execution as they are running
on an HPC node. In essence, workflows and processes are special functions
that can submit jobs to the HPC.
