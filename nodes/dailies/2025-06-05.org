How can I score the top number of GO terms if they are different for each comparison?

Say I wanted to display the top 10 terms that are significant to all of them?

Maybe I could use the lowest median p-value? Average could work too. Anyway, I need some
scoring metric, should probably address in the meeting tommorrow. Seems like I should use
p-value for the scoring though.

So, turns out the plot can handle the sets not sharing the top N, but there is no way to
determine how many shared there will be. In essence, I can't conbtrol how many terms will
show up in the final plot, but I can define a range of N * (number of datasets).


I keep getting distracted, wonder what I should do. I like this note taking system though.

I seem to have maxed out my brain capacity for the day. I'm going to stop working now.
