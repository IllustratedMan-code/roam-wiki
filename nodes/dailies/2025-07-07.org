Today I need to meet with Shreeja about the phenotype RElI.
I also need to work on the nextflow stuff.

* Phenotype RELI

- Do everything that is autoimmune (in excel sheet)
- Autoimmune, Inflammatory immune allergic IBD Infections, Cancer
- Ancestry is in gwas directory
- Try to use nextflow workflow from Andrew



* Nextflow pipeline design


Due to the existence of named workflows, I can create a sub-workflow that
correspond to each make target. I want to allow the data to be setup in a
similar way to the existing script, so sub-directories for each of the data
orgin. Then I can use the metadata to find the paths for the data files.

- Can nextflow search directories? (Yes, can use globs)
