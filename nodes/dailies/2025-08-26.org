Today, I need to look more into the script that Phillip sent and try to adapt for our purposes.
Also, I need to look at Molly's script and finish setting up RELI.

According to Phil, the chromHMMalign script takes some reference bed file.
-----

I emailed everybody about it, so hopefully they will have some idea. Now I'll see if
I can sus out molly's merge script.

-----

I now have a path to the blacklist and chromHMM file so I can move ahead with that

I should check out molly's script in the last 10 minutes
