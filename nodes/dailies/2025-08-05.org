Today I need to organize myself by beginning to
understand my old script and potentially trying to
put it in nextflow.


The inputs to the script are homer results. So,
all I need to do is write a nextflow pipeline that takes homer
results as inputs. So, I should come up a template repo that can be used for
pipelines separated into different scripts. Then, a makefile can handle them I guess.
