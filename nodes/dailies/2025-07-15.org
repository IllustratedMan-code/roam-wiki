Today I need to remove any extra garbage that is in the nextflow pipeline.
I should be able to run the main.nf file without any errors.

I'm rewriting the pipeline initialization scripts to handle excel sheets. I want to first
convert the excel sheet, then convert it into a nextflow channel.

This shouldn't be too difficult, but I also need to search the input directory and match to
the csv paths.
