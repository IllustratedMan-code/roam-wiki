I need to determine the best way to organize the PU.1 directory into a
nextflow pipeline. It is possible that I can use subworkflows that each
correspond to a makefile target, like figure1, figure2, etc.

Then, I need to reorganize all of the data directories and track down
the flow of data to find the original data inputs and organize those.

Let's try to break this down into subtasks:

- Find original data inputs
- reoganize data directories into Data folder
- connect existing scripts with subworkflows

I think the point to focus on is the intervene code. That will get me from the
current figure workflow to the original location of the data.


Additionally, Andrew wanted me to look at the reusable subworkflows directory
though, I'm not sure that they will be that useful.


Also, I really need to rewrite this stupid darkroom-mode
