Today, I need to ask Andrew about the reli container.

Also, I need to finish the Homer viz script.

Ok, So I need to add the homer files to the test.

Ok, added the homer files to the test, and got the nextflow
script in shape. But I still need to edit the barplot script
as the way nextflow stages files makes it difficult to use
directory names as metadata. Nextflow developers consider this
an antipattern, which is annoying.

I also need to create a new container for this, as there are some dependencies (namely scipy) missing.
