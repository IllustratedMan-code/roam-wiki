Today, there is a meeting about the PU.1 project. I just updated my pathway analysis
figure ([[id:5b5bc282-31e2-4eb5-8298-434be3577e1d][GREAT]]), but I am not quite satisfied with it.

The top ten terms are currently selected after intersection with GO slim terms.
Maybe it makes more sense to do it after? I'm not sure. In the meeting, we decided this was mostly
fine, but needs an additional p value cutoff. I now need to adjust the p value to correspond
the number of go slim terms.
