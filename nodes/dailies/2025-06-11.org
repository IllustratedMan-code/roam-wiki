Ok, so the intervene code doesn't actually combine the peaksets,
instead, there is a script called =union_peaksets.R= located here

PU.1/manuscript/Figures/old_analysis/upset_plot/union-peaksets.R


This operates on reli_pairwise, which is a directory I generated with
the =meta-to-reli= make target.

To get this into nextflow, need to go back to the meta-to-reli script
and adapt it to nextflow. Think that script submits reli jobs though,
so may need to talk to andrew about getting the subworkflow
