So, first, let's check out the new classes for this semester and see if I need to get any new textbooks.

Ok, so the patient safety class is not there yet, but the database class is.

It appears that I do not have to do anything before starting class tomorrow.

Ok, I think I should set up the phenotype reli before I forget what I am doing again.
I'll hold off on the nextflowification of it until phil's version is ready to be containerized.

Think that would be a lot easier than the old version anyhow.

That being said, I need to get the sets from Molly's email as well as the bed files from the Homer run.
So let's do that.

Ok, I think I set up a script that will copy all the bed_files in correctly, the only thing I need is Molly's
info about how she generated the merged sets.

-----

Now, I need to set up Phil's nextflow figure.

The first thing I have to do is rewrite the python script a bit, then I need to recreate what the
workflow should be based on the description he gave me.  I have hopefully rewritten the python script
well enough, so on to the work flow.

I needed to ask Phil about the nextflow script as I didn't understand what a variable meant.
