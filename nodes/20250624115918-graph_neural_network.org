A graph neural network is a type of [[id:4b274313-aa03-4018-8c3c-bbd0a51e7a7e][neural network]] that learns the relationships between nodes in a graph.
The difference between a graph neural network and a regular neural network is that each node directly corresponds
to some feature of the data, meaning the weights can be used directly, rather than by proxy (via a classifier).
