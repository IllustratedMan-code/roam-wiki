#+title: Lapwing

Lapwing is a steno theory based on the default theory in Plover. The original
Plover theory was developed over long years in the live captioning profession and was
originally based on the national captioning institute's theory, which was in turn based
on the StenED theory. Lapwing is intended to trim the fat from these theories and remove as many
inconsistencies in the theory as possible.

This makes Lapwing easier to learn but potentially slower than the other theories. Since
I am a hobbiest stenographer, I don't need the theoretical speed, but greatly benefit from
the ease of use.
