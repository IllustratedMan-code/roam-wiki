#+title: RELI

RELI is a tool used to perform comparison analysis
between CHIP-seq peak sets. It essentially finds the peaks that overlap
and assigns a probability to that overlap.
RELI is developed by the [[id:07b48a23-b9b4-4d30-ab3a-ade50241355a][weirauch lab]].

There are two main paradigms of RELI usage: phenotype RELI and pairwise RELI.

These two paradigms are only different in that they use different sources of
BED files for their operation. Phenotype RELI requires BED files corresponding
to specific phenotypes. Each phenotype is then "RELIed" on the dataset of interest (a group of bed files).
Pairwise RELI simply uses one bed files in the dataset of interest and "RELIes" it against all the other
bed files in the dataset.
