#+title: CELLNEST


* Inputs
- Spatial transcriptomics data
- Ligand-receptor database
- Expression threshold
- Distance threshold

* Preprocessing


* Definitions
- Relay Networks
- Spatial transcriptomics
  - Spots vs Cells
  - 2D vs 3D
- Merfish (single-cell)
- Visium (Spots)
  - requires cell segmentation
- Knowledge graph
- convolutional neural network
- Encoder/Decoder
- Embeddings
- Structured vs Unstructured data
- Single cell vs bulk transcriptomics
  - Look at sample data
- [[id:6d281e77-141d-4ad7-b29c-338f3d9cf0f4][Graph Neural Network]]


* Questions
- How do they identify paracrine/juxtacrine/etc

* Questions to lab mates
- Visium vs VisiumHD

    
* Potential Critiques
- Database is Cancer focused??
- Does the receptor ligand database being incomplete affect the output
- Why did they pick specific thresholds?


* Potential Questions
- How does cell segmentation work?
- 

* future directions
- How does signaling change in embryonic development
