#+title: Drawing Boxes

This seems like an excercise that many artists recommend. By drawing many boxes,
one begins to understand a form's place in 3D space.

One of the things I struggle the most with is consistency. By drawing similar shapes
over and over, this should be improved.

* Tutorial
Here is a [[https://drawabox.com/lesson/250boxes][Tutorial]] that goes into great detail on how you should draw your boxes.
I think that while this may be effective, drawing lots of boxes will just help, especially
if one looks at each box when they finish and contemplate how they might rotate it.

A real box is also helpful, as certain changes in perspective will change how the box looks.
I model my boxes in blender, which also gives me a light reference. I can freely change the scale
of the box.
