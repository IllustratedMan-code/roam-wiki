#+title: Hi-C


Hi-C is an [[id:39ab05a9-a025-44f9-b652-a2ce4a5330a6][in vivo]] high throughput assay that represents 3D chromatin conformation.

It works by crosslinking chromatin together, then breaking the chromatin, leaving DNA sequences that
correspond to 3d connections between chromatin.

Hi-C is an "all vs all" assay, meaning that it finds the relationships between all segments of chromatin.
