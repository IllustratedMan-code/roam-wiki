#+title: Cis-BP

- An online library of transcription factors and their DNA binding motifs
- Developed by [[id:07b48a23-b9b4-4d30-ab3a-ade50241355a][Weirauch lab]]

* Database of Binding motifs for TFs
- multiple TFs can interact and bind differently, resulting in composite motifs
- JASPAR, TRANSFAC(paid) are alternatives
- Cis = Catalogue of inferred sequence
- 741 species, 89 tf families

** CapSelex data is used to generate motifs
- TF-TF binding data
- Can generate motifs not found /in vivo/

** Similarity regression is an algorithm to compare motifs
