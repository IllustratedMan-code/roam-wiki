Blender is a free open source 3D modeling/Animation software. While many would say
that blender may not be particularly good at any particular task (compared to paid alternatives),
it shines in its versatility. Pretty much any step along the 3D animation pipeline is covered,
whether that be video editing, compositing, modeling, sculpting, etc.
