#+title: Krita

Krita is a drawing and painting software that aims to replicate the feature set of
photoshop for digital art. It is somewhat more userfriendly than [[id:946d0c50-27c5-4424-9d15-ca466c8e76d0][blender]], but can
be used to do similar things in the 2D space. It shines in its brush selection
and relative ease of use.
